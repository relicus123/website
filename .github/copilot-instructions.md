# Workspace Instructions

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, MongoDB, Razorpay).
- [x] Scaffold the Project (already initialized in this workspace).
- [x] Customize the Project (backend APIs, Razorpay, MongoDB models, frontend UI in place).
- [x] Install Required Extensions (none required via setup info).
- [x] Compile the Project (npm run build; warns if env vars missing).
- [x] Create and Run Task (not required; no custom VS Code tasks needed now).
- [ ] Launch the Project (start dev server or production start after env setup).
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete (keep README and this file current).

## Execution Guidelines

- Track progress with the todo tool; mark steps complete with short summaries.
- Keep communication concise; summarize skipped steps (e.g., no extensions needed).
- Use the workspace root `.` for commands; avoid creating new folders unless requested (except `.vscode` for tasks).
- Only install extensions provided by `get_project_setup_info`.
- Prefer placeholders only when noted; avoid unnecessary media or links.
- For VS Code extension work, consult VS Code API docs via the provided tool.

## Task Completion Definition

- Project scaffolded and compiled without errors.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists and is current.
- `README.md` exists and is up to date.
- User has clear instructions to debug/launch the project.
